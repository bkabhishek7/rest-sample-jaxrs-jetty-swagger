# rest-sample-jaxrs-jetty-swagger

This is a restful web services sample with jax-rs, Embedded jetty and swagger (without web.xml) for beginners (java developers). Follow the following steps to run the project.

1)Download the sample project and import as a maven plugin.

2)If you run into an error with pom.xml, google it (StackOverflow has the answer) or just comment-out that part (do not comment dependencies, do maven update/force update to resolve dependecies).

3)Run the Main class: RestApplication

4)Hit the browser with localhost:8080

I have just put all things together, for better/detailed explanation of the plugin follow the linkÂ https://gist.github.com/nosmokingpistol/302c4c3ef30f183cf70e. <-This is a very good article for beginners.
